> ⓘ On MacOS, it is necessary to unquarantine SDK libraries. Otherwise, quarantine attributes prevent their usage. The simplest way to unquarantine the SDK library is to strip the quarantine attributes recursively for all the files in the package. Follow these steps:
>1. Open **Terminal**.
>2. Assuming the name of your project is `myproject` under your home folder, run this command: `xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine ~/myproject/Library/PackageCache/dolbyio.comms.unity*`.

### Apple Silicon
If you are using Unity from an Apple Silicon Mac (e.g., M1), please be aware that currently the SDK is only distributed as x64 binary for Mac. You need to configure the Unity project under `File` > `Build Settings` and select `Intel 64bits` to make it work.
